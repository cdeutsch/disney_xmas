h2. About @cmdparse@

Some new programs use a "command style" command line. Examples for such programs are the "svn"
program from Subversion and the "gem" program from Rubygems. The standard Ruby distribution has no
library to create programs that use such a command line interface.

This library, cmdparse, can be used to create such a command line interface. Internally it uses
optparse or any other option parser library to parse options and it provides a nice API for
specifying commands and subcommands.

A typical command line for a program which uses commands looks like this:

<pre>
  $ net --verbose ipaddr add 192.168.0.1 193.150.0.1
</pre>
